    \begin{itemize*}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{.00pt}
        \item Golang Package which provides a two phase parser for RDF files linearized using RDF/XML format. It will be used to represent the rdf files in memory and write back in different formats like json, xml, yaml.

    %       \item \textbf{Abstract}: Grading essays on a large scale is a time consuming process. Project illustrates the use of LSTM units in a Deep Recurrent Neural Network to grade essays converted to number vector by using another shallow neural network, Word2Vec used to get numeric feature vector representation for a given essay. The validation accuracy achieved was 97.32 .

    \item \textbf{\small{Robocon's theme based bot}} \hfill {\small{{\textbf{[Feb '18 - March '18]}}}}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Worked with Robocon team to make several modules for the final autonomous and manual robot for Robocon competition 2018 including color detection using TCS3200 and IP as well.
        \item Made a line follower bot tuned by PID using LSA08.
